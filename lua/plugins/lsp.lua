			-- Brief Aside: **What is LSP?**
			--
			-- LSP is an acronym you've probably heard, but might not understand what it is.
			--
			-- LSP stands for Language Server Protocol. It's a protocol that helps editors
			-- and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
			--
			-- In general, you have a "server" which is some tool built to understand a particular
			-- language (such as `gopls`, `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, etc). These Language Servers
			-- (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
			-- processes that communicate with some "client" - in this case, Neovim!
			--
			-- LSP provides Neovim with features like:
			--  - Go to definition
			--  - Find references
			--  - Autocompletion
			--  - Symbol Search
			--  - and more!
			--
			-- Thus, Language Servers are external tools that must be installed separately from
			-- Neovim. This is where `mason` and related plugins come into play.
			--
			-- If you're wondering about lsp vs treesitter, you can check out the wonderfully
			-- and elegantly composed help section, :help lsp-vs-treesitter

			--  This function gets run when an LSP attaches to a particular buffer.
			--    That is to say, every time a new file is opened that is associated with
			--    an lsp (for example, opening `main.rs` is associated with `rust_analyzer`) this
			--    function will be executed to configure the current buffer
